\SlideTitle{An Example}
We start with an example.
Consider the family of elliptic curves and family of points,
\[\HighlightDisplay{
  E:y^2=x^3+x+T^2,\qquad P=(0,T).
  }
\]
\EndPart
\vspace{-5pt}
We are interested in studying how frequently the \emph{specialized
point} $P_t=(0,t)$ is a point of finite order on the \emph{specialized
elliptic curve} $E_t$.
\EndPart
\vspace{10pt}
For example, setting $t=0$, we find that
\[\HighlightDisplay{
   \text{$P_0=(0,0)$ is a point of order~$2$ on~$E_0$.}
  }
\]
\EndPart
Similarly,
\[\HighlightDisplay{
  t=\frac{\sqrt[4]{\sqrt5-1}}{2}
  \quad\text{makes $P_t$ a point of order $5$ on $E_t$.}
  }
\]
\EndSlide

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\BeginSlide
\SlideTitle{The Specialization Map}
In general, given an elliptic curve~$E$ defined over $K(T)$, 
\[\HighlightDisplay{
  E:y^2 = x^3+A(T)x+B(T),
  }
\]
each
$t\in K$ defines a \DefTerm{Specialization Map}
\[\HighlightDisplay{
  \s_t : E\bigl(K(T)\bigr) \longrightarrow E_t(K).
  }
\]
\EndPart
Thus given a point $P=\bigl(x(T),y(T)\bigr)\in E\bigl(K(T)\bigr)$, we
compute $\s_t(P)$ by evaluating at~$T=t$:
\[\HighlightDisplay{
  \s_t(P)=\bigl(x(t),y(t)\bigr)\in E_t(K) : y^2=x^3+A(t)x+B(t).
  }
\]
\EndPart
It is natural to ask how frequently independent points in~$E\bigl(K(T)\bigr)$
remain independent when specialized. Equivalently, how large is
the \DefTerm{exceptional set}
\[\HighlightDisplay{
  \Ecal(E,K) \stackrel{\scriptscriptstyle\text{def}}{=}
  \bigl\{ t\in K : \text{$\s_t$ fails to be injective }\bigr\}?

\SlideTitle{Heights and Specialization}
The theorem is proven using  a height specialization result. 
We fix an ample symmetric divisor~$D$ on~$A$ and consider 
three height functions:
\[\HighlightDisplay{
  \begin{aligned}
    \hhat_t : A_t(\Qbar)&\longrightarrow \RR,
      &&\text{canonical height wrt $D_t$,} \\
    \hhat : A\bigl(\Qbar(T)\bigr) &\longrightarrow \RR,
      &&\text{canonical height wrt divisor $D$,} \\
    h : T(\Qbar) &\longrightarrow\RR
      &&\text{height wrt degree 1 divisor.}
  \end{aligned}
  }
\]
\EndPart
These heights are related by a limit formula:
\TheoremBox{Theorem}{%
Let $P\in A\bigl(\Qbar(T)\bigr)$. Then
\[\HighlightDisplay{
  \lim_{\substack{t\in T(\Qbar)\\ h(t)\to\infty\\}}
  \frac{\hhat_t(P_t)}{h(t)} = \hhat(P).
  }
\]
}
\EndPart
The specialization theorem follows from nondegeneracy of $\hhat$ and
$\hhat_t$.

\vspace{-5pt}
Somewhat surprisingly, specialization results on elliptic curves and abelian
varieties preceded study of the analogous
question for the multiplicative group.%
\EndPart
\vspace{5pt}
We again start with an example.
\[\HighlightDisplay{
  \begin{gathered}
    \text{For which $t\in\QQ$ are $t$ and $t-2$}\\
    \text{ multiplicatively dependent?}
  \end{gathered}
  }
\]
\EndPart
If either $t$ or $t-2$ equals~$1$ or~$-1$, they are dependent, so
that's $t\in\{-1,1,3\}$. Are there other $t\in\QQ$?
\EndPart
\vspace{-5pt}
\[\HighlightDisplay{

  \end{gathered}
  }
\]
\EndPart 
Of course, if we allow $t\in\Qbar$, there are many exceptional
values.  Indeed, each equation $t^n(t-2)^m=1$ with $n,m\in\ZZ$,
$(m,n)\ne(0,0)$ gives finitely many $t\in\Qbar$ such that $t$ and
$t-2$ are multiplicatively dependent.

There exist $C_1,C_2>0$ such that for all $m_1,\ldots,m_r\in\ZZ$ and

$\deg\left(f_1^{m_1}\cdots f_r^{m_r}\right) \gg \max |m_i|$.

A general theorem says that
\[\HighlightDisplay{
    h\bigl(f(t)\bigr) \ge (\deg f)h(t) - c(f),
  }

but that's no good, since $c(f)$ depends on $f$. It requires an
intricate argument to replace the constant $c(f)$ with
$\deg(f)c(f_1,\ldots,f_r)$ when~$f$ is in the group generated by
$f_1,\ldots,f_r$.

\SlideTitle{An Unlikely Intersection}
\vspace{-5pt}
We can reformulate the BMZ result as follows. Consider the map
\[\HighlightDisplay{
  F = (f_1,\ldots,f_r) : T \longrightarrow \AA^r.
  }
\]
Since $T$ is a curve, we have
\[\HighlightDisplay{
    \begin{aligned}
      f_1(t),\ldots&,f_r(t)\text{ are multiplicatively dependent} \\
      &\Longleftrightarrow
      \text{$F(t)$ lies on some
	$\underbrace{X_1^{e_1}\cdots X_r^{e_r}=1}_{\text{subgroup 
	       of $\GG_m^r$}}$.} \\
    \end{aligned}
  }
\]
\EndPart
Thus the exceptional set is the intersection
\[\HighlightDisplay{

    \Ecal(f_1,\ldots,f_r) = \operatorname{Image}(F) \cap

Up to now we have been considering one-paramter families, i.e.,

Let
\[\HighlightDisplay{
  f_1,\ldots,f_r\in\Qbar(T_1,\ldots,T_n)^*

variables. Each relation
\[\HighlightDisplay{
  f_1(t)^{e_1}\cdots f_r(t)^{e_r}=1

\[\HighlightDisplay{

It is natural to guess that

We thus have a rational map

If $F$ is not dominant,  a result of Laurent gives the desired
result.
%% Laurent's Theorem
%% Let $X\subset\GG_m^n$ be a subvariety. Then the Zariski closure of
%% $X\cap\GG_m^n(\CC)_\tors$ is a \emph{finite} union of translates of
%% algebraic subgroups of~$\GG_m^n$ by torsion points.
Let
\[\HighlightDisplay{

elementary upper bound (on an open set)
\[\HighlightDisplay{

\SlideTitle{Increasing the Codimension}
The codimension condition used to define 
unlikely intersections between subvarieties and subgroups
is set up so that each individual $X\cap H$ is finite.
But since there may be infinitely many~$H$, the exceptional
set consisting of all unlikely intersections
\[\HighlightDisplay{
  \Ecal = X \cap \bigcup_H H
  }
\]
is generally infinite. In this case, one hopes to prove that the points in
$\Ecal$  in a geometrically
described subset have bounded height.
\EndPart
\vspace{10pt}
If we increase the codimension condition by one, then most individual
intersections  $X\cap H$ should be empty, so we might expect
the full exceptional set to be finite.

Let $\Gcal\to T$ be a semiabelian scheme over a base~$T$, all defined
over~$\CC$. For any~$d$, let $\Gcal^{[d]}$ be the union of the

be an irreducible closed subvariety of~$\Gcal$. Then
$X^\oa\cap\Gcal^{[\dim X+1]}$ is contained in a finite union of
semiabelian subschemes of~$\Gcal$ of positive codimension.}

The original theorem that we discussed says that the set of~$t$ for
