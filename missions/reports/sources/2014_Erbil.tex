\section{The visit}

I arrived in Erbil on December 1, 2014 at 3:45AM and I left Erbil on December 9, 2014 at 4:50AM. During my stay I was housed 
at the Guest House of \emph{Salahaddin University} on Zanko St, approximately 20 minutes walk from the \emph{College of Sciences of Salahaddin
University} where I gave the lectures of my workshop.

The dates and topics of my lectures were:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Monday December 1: Introductory talk (\textit{addressed to all member of the Mathematics Department})
 \item Tuesday December 2: Algorithmic Complexity 
 \item Wednesday December 3: Discrete Logs and th Euclidean Algorithm
 \item Thursday December 4: Elliptic curves over finite fields 1
 \item Thursday December 4: Factoring integers and Producing primes (for undergraduate students)
 \item Sunday December 7: Elliptic curves over finite fields 2
 \item Monday December 8: Elliptic curves over finite fields 3
\end{itemize}

The local organization was efficiently taken care by Professor Herish Omer and the initial invitation and the connection with
CIMPA was efficiently dealt with by Fatima Aboud.

The workshop was attended by around 20 participants and at least three came from outside Erbil.

My expenses were paid in part by CIMPA and in part by the French Embassy in Iraq.

The topics of the first three lectures we suitable for the audience and, in my opinion, well received.

\section{Followups}

Mathematicians at the Salahaddin University are eager to establish contacts with colleagues in foreign institutions. 

With professor Parween Humadi, we discussed of the possibility of a joint supervision
of a student at the doctoral level on a topic related with Elliptic curves and number Theory. I hope that this project
will materialize.

During 2014, especially after my visit in Baghdad of April 2014, I tried to organize the acceptance of Iraqi students
at a Doctoral program at the Universit√† Roma Tre. The project reached an extremely advanced stage. Unfortunately, very recently,
I discovered that Iraqi students with a fellowship from the \textbf{Iraq Minister of Higher Education} are allowed to bring
their fellowship only to international institutions that are accredited with the Minister. 

I wish that my University is added to the list of accredited University both in that of \textbf{Iraq Minister of Higher Education} 
and, if possible, in that of the \textbf{Kurdistan Minister of Higher Education}.

\section{Security issues}

I received the invitation to deliver the workshop in March 2014. Later, in early Augost 2014, due to the deterioration of the safety
conditions in Kurdistan, 
the organization of the workshop was suspended with the agreement that the final decision on its realization,
would be delivered in late October 2014.

At the end of October the local organizers gave their Nulla Hosta to the organization. So the workshop took place as originally planned except for
a shortening of its length to 8 days.

The information coming from the Kurdish colleagues was very different from the information circulated from  the Italian
official sources. For example in
\texttt{http://www.viaggiaresicuri.it/?iraq} , on the 11.11.2014 bulletin, it was described a situation so potentially
dangerous, that it was suggested not to make this trip. I decided to trust the Kurdish 
news and I went to Erbil.

During my entire stay I always felt safe in Erbil. So, my impression was quite positive on the safety of the city.

The day after my arrival, I called the Italian consulate in Erbil and Consul Carmelo Ficarra advised me that
since June the atmosphere in Erbil had changed and that he suggested to be careful during my movements in Erbil avoiding Shopping Centers
and in general, public places. He also kindly instructed me on how to transmit the data of my presence to the consulate office.

I partially followed the advise of Mr Ficarra but I cannot avoid to point out the differences between 
the recommendation from the Italian officials and the Kurdish one.

However, on one side, I can agree with the recommendation of ``Avoiding unnecessary trips to Erbil''. In fact, although it is a beautiful
and fascinating city, it might not be the right time in history to have a large number of tourists visiting Erbil. 
%I am not able to understand why all type of trips should be avoided. 
But on the other side, the activities on which CIMPA is involved, for a variety of different reasons, often take place in countries 
where avoiding unnecessary trips might be a good idea. Finally, in my opinion, this visit in Kurdistan was very necessary and I am personally highly satisfied of
its success.
