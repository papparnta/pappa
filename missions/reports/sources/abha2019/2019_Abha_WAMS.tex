\section{Visit to ASA - Jeddah}

The visit was the result of an invitation by Professor Adel N. Alahmadi \texttt{<adelnife2@yahoo.com>} director
of ASA. The invitation was suggested by Florian Luca, member of ASA. FL was aware of the visit of FP to Abha in occasion of the WAMS school and suggested a stop for a couple of days in Jeddah to discuss future cooperation with the members of ASA including the possibility of the organization of a WAMS or a CIMPA school at King Abdulaziz University. 

FP gave a slides presentation about CIMPA outlining the history and way of functioning of CIMPA. He also informed Adel of the major
problem encountered by the organizers of the CIMPA school in Abha (explained later in this report). Namely the fact that none of the non-Saudi participants in the WAMS school was given the entry VISA to Saudi Arabia. AA is quite confident that, in the event that a CIMPA/WAMS school takes place at King Abdulaziz University (KAU) in Jeddah, the entry VISA can be obtained. In fact AA is the KAU responsible for the office that deals with the VISA for all the visitors at KAU. So he knows all the aspects of the matter.

Of the presentation were presents: Florian Luca, Adel N. Alahmadi, Alaa Altassan (on the left in the photo below) and
Hatoon Shoaib (on the right in the photo below), all members of ASA. \bigskip

KAU has a nice campus with suitable infrastructures to host an international school. Furthermore, the important international airport of Jeddah and the central geographical position on the city would make of KAU an ideal location.

\section{WAMS school at King Khalid University, Abha}

The idea of this WAMS school is due to Dr. Abdalaziz Alanazi from University of Tabuk. During the CIMPA research school on
Explicit Number Theory at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa on January 8 - 19, 2018 he approached FL and FP with the proposal that originated this event. He is an Alumni of
Wits and he was attending the CIMPA school as participant.

We accepted enthusiastically to join him in the enterprise. At the time the issue of accessibility to the school to Female participants was raised. Abdalaziz ensured that also woman would be able to attend. This turned out to be correct.

Soon after we discovered the difficulties that CIMPA has already encountered in Saudi Arabia in 2012 at Thuwal where a CIMPA research school in ``Applied Mathematics on Uncertainty Quantification'' was held.
If fact we learned that during that school there were no international participants. At the time Abdalaziz was hoping that the problem would not present again.

After some discussions we selected the following speakers: Florian Luca, C\'ecile Armana, Paul Voutier and the three of us. C\'ecile and Paul had to cancel their participation after the school was approved.

Furthermore Abdalaziz proposed to hold the school at the University of Abha where the colleagues were interested in hosting the program. We were also asked to include a course in Differential Geometry and later, after the cancellation of Paul Voutier and the school was already approved, we were asked to include a course in Dynamical Systems. 

The deadline for applications was on  February 10, 2019 and the responses were communicated soon after February 15, 2019. 
We selected 21 foreign participants from the following countries:

The process of granting a VISA is a difficult task in Saudi Arabia and we all underestimated the difficulties. 

While the visas of all the speakers were granted in the due time, two weeks before the beginning of the school we learned that
none of the selected international participants was granted the visa and, at that late stage, it was unlikely that they would receive it on time to participate in the school.

The result was that, as it happened in 2012 in Thuwal, no international participants were attending the school. Both the local organizer were extremely sorry for the development. It is clear that this was not under their control. 

Nevertheless the atmosphere of the classroom was excellent and the lectures by speakers were delivered clearly. Various other aspects of the organization were excellent and the immense work of the local organizers, especially of Professor Ali Alkhaldi and
his team, produced a successful event. 

Although I do not have the precise numbers on the attendance to the school, I can say that, at different times, there were at least 14 women participants and about the same number of men participants.\bigskip

\subsection*{The schedule}

The schedule was proposed and approved by the scientific committee several months before the school and it was published in the web page:

\centerline{\includegraphics[width=10cm]{schedule_old.png}}

At our arrival in Abha, we were informed that the president of King Khalid University had changed the schedule lowering the amount of hours of lecture, removing one of the days of lecture and canceling the afternoon tutorials.

\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Security issues}

Abha is a safe destination. However, the proximity of Abha to the Yemen border make of it a target.
On June 17${\text{th}}$ there was an attack with no consequences at Abha airport. 

{\scriptsize\texttt{https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/06/yemen-houthis-claim-attack-saudi-arabia-abha-airport-190617012821518.html}}

Later on June 23$^{\text{rd}}$ there was a second attack on Abha airport.

{\scriptsize\texttt{https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/06/killed-wounded-attack-saudi-airport-190623193747842.html}}

None of the events had any effect on the WAMS school.
\subsection*{The budget}

The costs of the school were entirely covered by King Khaled University. All local expenses and all travel expenses for speakers
were paid directly by the local organization. 

In the original budget the amount of 4.000Euro allocated by CIMPA should have been spent exclusively to cover the travel expenses of international participant. The denial of the entry VISA and the consequent absence of them, resulted in the fact that nothing
was spent by CIMPA. The entire budget from CIMPA is therefore unspent.
\section{Followups and Final recommendations}
It is of course unfortunate that the school was not accessible to international participants and the fact that this happened for 
the second time and for the second event ever organized in Saudi Arabia is even more remarkable.
Nevertheless, we would like to stress one more time that the local organizers Abdalaziz Alanazi and Ali Alkhaldi made their best to avoid this defect. 

We strongly believe that, due to its geographic region, due to the particular organization of the Saudi academic system where the majority
of professors are foreigner, mostly originally from countries in regions of crucial interest for CIMPA (Egypt, Morocco, Pakistan, India, Algeria, ....) it is very important CIMPA continues its activities in Saudi Arabia. In particular Shaban Aly (originally from Egypt), Khaled AL-Homam (originally from Yemen) and Akram Ali (originally from India) are all member of the Department of Mathematics of King Khalid University and collaborated actively to the organization of the WAMS school. Shaban Aly has also expressed a serious interest in organizing and EMA school in Applied Mathematics in Egypt next year.

Abdalaziz Alanazi, Ali Alkhaldi and also Adel N. Alahmadi are example devoted, dynamic and reliable young mathematicians. The type of researcher that deserve support and trust for future activities.

Abdalaziz and Ali are considering the possibility to organize another school next summer which will not be under the umbrella of CIMPA. This would be a new challenge that could finally succeed in bringing foreign participants in Saudi Arabia. We believe the their efforts should be morally supported by CIMPA. 

Regarding the attendance of women, we were surprised at the enthusiasm of the women applicants at the possibility to attend the Abha WAMS school. One of the female applicant that was not selected 
was willing to participate in the school at her own expenses.

In conclusion, we believe that our Saudi colleagues should be encouraged to apply to other CIMPA/WAMS schools in the future. They should be assisted and stimulated to solve the problem of entry visa to international participants.
